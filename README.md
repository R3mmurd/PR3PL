# PR3PL

This is a little programming language designed to learn how to use the data
structure Tree in order to parse and evaluate a program written in it.
It was developed for the course "Programaci√≥n 3" at Universidad de Los Andes, 
Venezuela.

Here is a fun program (interprete.C) to write lines in this programming
language and view the result of its evaluation.
